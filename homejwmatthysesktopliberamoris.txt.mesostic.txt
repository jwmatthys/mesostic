                                  deCeived me and the earth fails from

                               is suBstantial real but false and hollow 
                     like her faith On which i built 
          my trust she came i knew nOt how 
   her face and hearing her words liKe sighs

                          have come Back with her smile--she has 
           blighted all turned all tO poison and 
   childish tears yet the barbed arrOw is 
                                 ranK in the kingdom of love--but i 

      could have wished it had been For an

                    to make her an oFfer the instant

                 stupid calm and i fOund she was 
                         unwell in cOnsequence of what had happened 
                              to be Kept in remembrance of the 

                            unhappy Farewell no notice was taken nor 
                       did i expect Any the following morning

                               to teA i found the little girl 
             on her knees busy in paCking up 
                my things and a largE paper parcel 
                           on the taBle which i could not 
                at first tell what tO make of 
                                    On opening it however i soon found

                                    And i have doubted of it since

                      to get the booKs back i however 

     sobered and wavered by degrees From seeing

                          up in her Own likeness a serpent

                                    Folly and her own art and i 
                                    Asked her mother whether she thought she

                                   wAs free as with the least encouragement 
       refusal whether i might go baCk there 
                               and bE treated as an old friend 
         not a word of answer could Be got 
                                  frOm her on either point notwithstanding every 
                                 impOrtunity and intreaty but it was the 
                          hand i talKed to her of indifferent 

                        things and oF old times i asked 
      if she could get the little imAge mended 
          it was broken in three pieCes and 
                                  thE sword was gone but she would

                                  knOw i was as true a friend 
                           as ever wOman had--or if there was 
                                franKly as i shewed her all my 

  heart she drew out her handkerchieF and 
                wiped her eyes of teArs which sacred 
but so she stood while i pleaded my Cause to

                                    But without speaking a word without altering 
  a feature it was like a petrifactiOn of 
               a human face in the sOftest moment 
    of passion ah i said how you looK i 

                      in the agony oF my spirit that 
i might but live to see you look so Again and 
                 of the house and reCeived no answer 
                              i waitEd an hour expecting her and 
         fond of mended and it's to Be done 
         this evening she has been tO two 
                                    Or three places to see about it 
                               i tooK nearly the whole of the 

                evening or to read iF she chose 
                             or to wAlk out when it was 
             evening delighted as i Could be after 
                      all i had suffEred and lay the 
                                    Be for a moment out of the 
                                   hOuse where she was and the next 
                                   mOrning she tapped at the door--it was 
                   and begged to shaKe hands with her 

                    can not a word oF answer but 
         she looked full in my eyes As much 
                     and had not proCeeded many paces ruminating 
                            on chancE and change and old times 
      thought her alone some people Before me 
                                   mOved on and i saw another person 
            with her the murder was Out it 
          was a tall rather well-looKing young man 

                   but i did not at First recollect 
                            him we pAssed at the crossing of 
         had prevailed with him to aCcompany her 
                                  drEading some violence i returned went up 
                                    But you know you denied it lustily 
                           why did yOu not tell me all 
                                  abOut it at the time instead of 
    used to tell me you despised looKs--she didn't 

                                  i Found he had lived over the 
                                   wAy that he had been lured thence 
    at marriage and had gone away beCause as 
                                   hE said they were too much together 
                    and that it was Better for her 
                                   tO meet him occasionally out of doors 
                             there cOuld be no harm in them 
                                 walKing together no but you may go 

                        some where aFterwards-- one must trust to 
              one's principle for thAt consummate hypocrite i 
   help being alarmed at the influenCe of 
                                  onE over her whom she could hardly 
         that was all she liked him Better than 
                                   rOam the desert streets when turning a 
                                   cOrner whom should i meet but her 
  very lover i went up to him and asKed for 

                                  a Few minutes' conversation on a subject 
                                  thAt was highly interesting to me and 
                four hours' talk it Came out that 
                             for thrEe months previous to my quitting 
        london for scotland she had Been playing 
                                   hOur of her society and then i 
                                   tOok my turn so that we never 
                       her lover looKed in what a denouement 

    was too much what do you think oF all 
                             this shAll i tell you my opinion 
      frightful illusion i had embraCed the false 
                              florimEl instead of the true or was 
             like the man in the araBian nights 
                                  whO had married a goul how different 
                     was the idea i Once had of 
                             to thinK for ever with him like 

                 to my bosom this liFeless image which 
                                   wAs all that was left of my 
      love was the only thing to whiCh my

                     i seem to have Been thrown from 
                               the tOp of a precipice and to 
                              lie grOveling stunned and stupefied i am 
         melancholy lonesome and weaKer than a child 

   the worst is i have no prospect oF any 
                                    Alteration for the better she has cut 
         off all possibility of a reConcilement at 
                           any futurE period were she even to 
    herself nor do i see what is to Become of 
                  her unless she thrOws off the mask 
                                 at Once and runs a-muck at infamy 
          put her arms round his necK and 

                caress him and seem Fond of him 
                                  meAns nothing proves nothing no one concludes 
                              of my Calculation and may be out
